#Lessons Learned 
While doing this project. I had a very small moment of clarity where I realized
that with object oriented programming, you can build just about anything you want
as long as you have enough information to do so. 

The pre-project labs where we created a deck of cards was also very helpful learning the 
thought process behind building the objects in project.
